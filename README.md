## Gemini Image Demo

This project showcases the power of Google's Generative AI model, Gemini, in a user-friendly application designed for question-answering based on images. It leverages Streamlit for a seamless deployment experience.

**Key Features**

* **Interactive Image-Based Q&A:** Users can interact with the application by presenting images as prompts. Gemini's advanced algorithms will then process these images and generate insightful answers to your questions.
* **Simplified Deployment with Streamlit:** Streamlit, a popular Python framework, empowers you to readily deploy the application with minimal setup.
